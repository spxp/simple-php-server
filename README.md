### Features

This SPXP server implements the [Service Provider](https://github.com/spxp/spxp-specs/blob/master/SPXP-SPE-Spec.md) and the [Profile Management Extension](https://github.com/spxp/spxp-specs/blob/master/SPXP-PME-Spec.md). It supports:

* Registering and thus hosting an SPXP profile
* Publishing and deleting profile posts
* Connecting a hosted profile to another profile (simplified implementation)
* Migrating a profile to or from the server

### Caveats

This implementation is as simple and straight forward as possible and not optimized for performance.
